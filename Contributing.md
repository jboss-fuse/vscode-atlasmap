# How to provide a new version on VS Code Marketplace

* Check that the version in package.json has not been published yet
  * If already published:
    * Upgrade the version in package.json
    * Run 'npm install' so that the package-lock.json is updated
    * Push changes in a PR
    * Wait for PR to be merged
* Create a tag
* Push the tag to camel-tooling repository, it will trigger a build after few minutes
* Check build is working fine on [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/jboss-fuse/vscode-atlasmap)
* Wait that the new plugin version is validated by VS Code marketplace moderators (can take minutes or days)
* Prepare next iteration:
  * Upgrade the version in package.json
  * Run 'npm install' so that the package-lock.json is updated
  * Push changes in a PR
  * Follow PR until it is approved/merged
